  <p>Effective date: May 03, 2020</p>


  <p>There are three types of users, customer, seller and admin, sellers can create posts which will show their product
    information and sell it with desirable price.
    Customers are users which can buy and order products online. Admin has all permissions and can view registered users
    and delete them</p>
