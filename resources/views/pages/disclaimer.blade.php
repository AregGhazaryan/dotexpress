    <h1>Copyright Disclaimer</h1>

    <p>A copyright disclaimer protects original content against user theft. It explains that you own your website and
        everything on it — and that there are legal repercussions for using your work without permission.</p>

    <p><b>Copyright is a form of protection offered by US law for “original works of authorship.” An original work is
            defined by the US Copyright Office as:</b></p>

    <p>independently created by a human author and possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.</p>

    <p>As soon as a work is created and becomes reproducible, copyright protection automatically applies. A detailed
        copyright disclaimer is therefore not legally required, but acts as a strong deterrent against copyright
        infringement. It shows that you are aware of the law and will defend your claim.</p>

    <p> Your business’s copyright claim can be detailed in your terms and conditions under intellectual property rights:
        An example of intellectual property rights disclaimer clause
        The intellectual property rights clause from Termly’s Terms and Conditions Template</p>

    <p>This example disclaimer clause allows you to lay claim to your site’s creative assets. However, notifying users
        of your copyright as soon as they access your site is also important.</p>

    <p>One effective way to do this is to place a copyright notice in your site’s footer. It should comprise three
        parts:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The copyright symbol</li>
        <li>The year of publication</li>
        <li>The name of the copyright owner</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Effective date: May 03, 2020</p>
